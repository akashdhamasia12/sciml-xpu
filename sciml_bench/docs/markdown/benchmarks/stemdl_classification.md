# stemdl_classification Benchmark

The Scanning Transmission Electron Microscope Deep Learning (STEM-DL) benchmark was developed at Oakridge National Laboratory (ORNL). This benchmark trains a machine learning model which allows to classify Convergent Beam Electron Diffraction (CBED) patterns into one of the 230 crystallographic space groups. These patterns are generated by simulation and represent over 60000 solid-state materials covering almost all known crystal structures. The motivation for this benchmark is to explore the suitability of machine learning algorithms for the advanced analysis of CBED [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].

* Entity Type: Benchmark
* Main Domain: Material Sciences
* Sub Domain: Convergent Beam Electron Diffraction
* Task: Classification of diffraction patterns
* Relevant Datasets: stemdl_classification_ds1
* Implementation: Pytorch
* Authors: Junqi Yin, Sajal Dash, Aris Tsaris, Feiyi Wang, Arjun Shankar

The benchmark supports data parallel training and runs on multiple GPUs.
For training use this command: 
sciml-bench run stemdl_classification --mode training -b epochs 1 -b batchsize 32 -b nodes 1 -b gpus 1

For inference use this command:
sciml-bench run stemdl_classification --mode inference \
    --model ~/sciml_bench/outputs/stemdl_classification/stemdlModel.h5 \
    --dataset_dir ~/sciml_bench/datasets/stemdl_ds1 \
    -b epochs 1 -b batchsize 32 -b nodes 1 -b gpus 1
