# em_graphene_sim Dataset

em_graphene_sim is dataset from material sciences domain, specifically from electron microscopes. The dataset is made of pairs of noised and clean electron micrographs. The clean micrographs were generated by simulating electron microscope images, using atomic coordinates from molecular dynamics simulations and the MULTEM code. To simulate the non-homogeneous noise of high-rate EM we scale across the image according to a beam profile, before adding Poisson noise and finally including a selection of random dead pixels. Other details are:

* Data Source: Simulated
* Domain: Material Sciences
* Sub-Domain: Condensed Matter
* Data Type: Images [256 x 256 x 1]
* Enclosing Benchmark: em_denoise
* Data Size: 5GB
