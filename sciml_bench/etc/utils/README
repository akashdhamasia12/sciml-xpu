For downloading a dataset used by the benchmark use the script called dataDownload.sh. 
Make the script executable by running: chmod u+x dataDownload.sh. 
The data is downloaded by default into the local directory. 
For running the script supply the path to the remote server. 
For example for downloading the Graphene dataset run the following command:
dataDownload.sh s3://sciml-datasets/ms/em_graphene_sim ./graphene
