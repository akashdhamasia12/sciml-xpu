Template file for a benchmark implementation

To build a benchmark named 'exbench' into SciMLBench:

Step 1: Create a main file `sciml_bench/benchmarks/exbench/exbench.py`.
        A benchmark can have as many files as needed, but the main 
        file is the entry point for the framework, which should 
        be the same name as the benchmark name. 

Step 2: Implement `sciml_bench_training()` function in this template.
        This is the entry point for the training process. You may
        skip this step if the exbench is inference-focussed. 

Step 3: Implement `sciml_bench_inference()` function in this template.
        This is the entry point for the inference process. You may
        skip this step if the exbench is training-focussed.

Step 4: Make necessary entries in the config file located at 
        `sciml_bench/etc/configs/config.yml`. 

Step 5: Once fully tested, please contact us for final integration 
        as part of the SciMLBench suite.

You should also consult the documentation around this.
